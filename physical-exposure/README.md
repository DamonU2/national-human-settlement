# National Human Settlement - Physical Exposure

The Physical Exposure component of the National Human Settlement Layer (NHSL) includes a delineation of built-up areas and related functional land use classes for Census Dissemination Areas in urban centres and rural/remote communities across Canada. It provides detailed information on construction type, occupancy and design level for more than 9.1 million buildings; population dynamics at different times of day for 35.1 million people, and; capital asset valuation of buildings and contents totalling more than 8.3 trillion CAD$.

The building portfolio is classified using a combination of 36 construction taxonomies that include different types of wood, concrete, masonry, steel and prefabricated structures; and 33 occupancy classes that include a mix of residential, civic, commercial and industrial functional uses.  Context-specific mapping schemes for each combination of land use, construction type and occupancy class are used to allocate a distribution of building classes that reflect the overall structural form and function of a given neighbourhood.

Building populations at different times of day are estimated for standard workday hours when people are in offices, schools or other group facilities (9am-5pm); for morning and evening commute hours when people are in transit (7am-9am; 5pm-7pm), and; for evening hours when the majority of people are at home (7pm-7am).

Capital asset valuation is based on industry replacement costs of building archetypes for representative regions across Canada.

The building inventory is aligned with international standards for multi-hazard risk assessment and is suitable for use in other land use assessment applications that may require specific information on the form and/or function of the built environment.
