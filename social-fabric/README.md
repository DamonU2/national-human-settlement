# National Human Settlement - Social Fabric and Capacity Thresholds

The Social Fabric component of the National Human Settlement Layer (NHSL) utilizes available Census demographic data to evaluate broad spatial patterns of vulnerability, and neighbourhood-level capacities to withstand and recover from disaster events based on characteristics of housing, family structure, individual autonomy and financial agency.

Vulnerability and capacity threshold indicators help to identify underlying patterns of social inequity that may exist within a given community or region, and to address the question of who is likely to bear the greatest burden of risk following a disaster event. Levels of vulnerability for each component of the social vulnerability index are assessed using analytic methods adapted from the Cutter 'Hazards of Place Model' to screen and rank demographic variables based on their capacity to explain spatial patterns across a broad range of community archetypes including dense urban centres, surrounding suburban/exurban regions, and more distant rural and remote settlements.

Composite indicators describing characteristics of housing conditions, family structure, individual autonomy and financial agency provide a means of comparing relative levels of vulnerability from one region to another across Canada and help identify specific neighbourhoods within which capacities to withstand and recover from disaster events may be strained. Indicators are reported at the Census Dissemination Area level and can be used in conjunction with information on specific hazard threats to identify both potential hotspots of concern within a community or region, and areas in which proactive investments in planning and capacity development may be effective in building disaster resilience and longer-term sustainability.
