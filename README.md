# National Human Settlement Layer

## Overview of this Repository

This repository is used for the development of the National National Human Settlement Layer (NHSL), which is a collection of thematic datasets that describe the physical, social and economic characteristics of urban centres and rural/remote communities across Canada.  Detailed information on land use, buildings, people and capital assets are provided at the Census Dissemination Area administrative level for more than 454,000 settled areas across Canada.

Although developed to support quantitative risk assessments and implementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction at local and regional scales in Canada, the NHSL is also suitable for use in other integrated landscape modeling applications, including climate change adaptation and sustainable land use planning.
